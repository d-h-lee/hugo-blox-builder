I needed features for my lab website [AIML@K](https://aiml-k.github.io), but the template I am using ([Research Group](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/research-group/) - [github](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-research-group)) was no longer actively supported by Hugo Blox.

It seems to be related to Hugo Blox moving to Tailwind from Bootstrap. 

The current Hugo Blox documentations are valid for Tailwind-based templates. This means some portions of the documentations are not valid for my lab website usecase. 

I could not expect backports to be done fast enough to serve my needs. So I forked this builder repo, and made changes for my own use.

The changes in this repo may be not compatible to be pushed back to the main Hugo Blox repo. Meanwhile, I am pulling changes from the main Hugo Blox repo to keep my lab website up and running!
